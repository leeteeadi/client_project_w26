        <h2>Why You Need a Portfolio</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demonstrate real-world skills:</strong> Show concrete examples of your design, research, coding, writing, or analysis work.</li>
            <li><strong>Tell your story:</strong> Walk employers through your process, challenges, and learning outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Stand out from resumes alone:</strong> A portfolio adds depth that a one-page resume cannot.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare for interviews:</strong> Use your projects as talking points during interviews.</li>
        </ul>
